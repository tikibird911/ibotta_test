# Flask XLSX Modeling & Prediction App

This application is designed to read data from an XLSX (Excel) file, perform data modeling, and provide inference and prediction capabilities via a Flask web interface. It is intended as a demonstration of a typical data science workflow, from data ingestion to model deployment.

## Project Overview

This app allows users to upload an Excel file, processes the data, applies a machine learning model, and returns predictions. The goal is to provide an end-to-end example of how to operationalize data science models using Python and Flask.

---

## Features

- Upload XLSX files for analysis
- Data preprocessing and validation
- Model training (e.g., regression or classification)
- Real-time inference and prediction via web interface
- Downloadable results
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (optional, for cloning)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-xlsx-modeling.git
cd flask-xlsx-modeling
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
flask run
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Usage Guide

1. **Open the app** in your browser.
2. **Upload your XLSX file** using the provided form.
3. **Wait for processing**; the app will display data summaries and model predictions.
4. **Download results** if available.

---

## Modeling Approach

- **Data Ingestion:** Reads XLSX files using `pandas`.
- **Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes features.
- **Modeling:** Uses scikit-learn (e.g., LinearRegression, RandomForestClassifier) for training.
- **Inference:** Applies the trained model to new data for predictions.
- **Persistence:** Optionally saves trained models for reuse.

## Extending the App

- Add support for other file formats (CSV, JSON)
- Integrate additional machine learning models
- Enhance the web UI for better user experience
- Deploy to cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependency Issues:** Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed.
- **File Upload Errors:** Check file format and size.
- **Model Errors:** Inspect logs for stack traces; ensure data matches model expectations.
