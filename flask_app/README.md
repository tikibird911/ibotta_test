# Flask XLSX Modeling & Prediction App

This application is designed to read data from an XLSX (Excel) file, perform data modeling—including graph-based methods—and provide inference and prediction capabilities via a Flask web interface. It demonstrates a typical data science workflow, from data ingestion to model deployment, with a focus on using XGBoost and graph data techniques.

## Usage Guide

1. **Open the app** in your browser.
2. **Upload your XLSX file** using the provided form.
3. **Wait for processing**; the app will display data summaries, graph visualizations, and model predictions.
4. **Download results** if available.

## Modeling Approach

- **Data Ingestion:** Reads XLSX files using `pandas`.
- **Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, normalizes features, and constructs graph representations if applicable.
- **Modeling:** Uses XGBoost for training regression or classification models, leveraging both tabular and graph-derived features.
- **Inference:** Applies the trained XGBoost model to new data for predictions.
- **Persistence:** Optionally saves trained models for reuse.

---

## Graph Data & Methods

- **Graph Construction:** If the uploaded data contains relationships (e.g., networks, connections), the app constructs a graph using libraries such as `networkx`.
- **Graph Features:** Extracts features like node degree, centrality, clustering coefficients, or community assignments to enrich the dataset.
- **Integration with Modeling:** Graph-derived features are combined with tabular data and used as input for XGBoost models, enabling the model to capture complex relational patterns.
- **Visualization:** The app can display basic graph visualizations to help users understand the structure of their data.

## Extending the App

- Add support for other file formats (CSV, JSON)
- Integrate additional machine learning or graph neural network models
- Enhance the web UI for better user experience and graph exploration
- Deploy to cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependency Issues:** Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed.
- **File Upload Errors:** Check file format and size.
- **Model Errors:** Inspect logs for stack traces; ensure data matches model expectations.
- **Graph Construction Issues:** Verify that the data contains valid relationships for graph building.
